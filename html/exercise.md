Select “Save” or “Save as” from the File menu to get the Save As dialog box (Figure 4-4). The first thing you need to do is create a new folder that will contain all of the files for the site (in other words, it’s the local root folder).

Windows: Click the folder icon at the top to create the new folder.

Mac: Click the “New Folder” button.

Name the new folder bistro, and save the text file as index.html in it. Windows users, you will also need to choose “All Files” after “Save as type” to prevent Notepad from adding a “.txt” extension to your filename. The filename needs to end in .html to be recognized by the browser as a web document. See the sidebar Naming Conventions for more tips on naming files.

Just for kicks, let’s take a look at index.html in a browser. Launch your favorite browser (I’m using Google Chrome) and choose “Open” or “Open File” from the File menu. Navigate to index.html, and then select the document to open it in the browser. You should see something like the page shown in Figure 4-5. We’ll talk about the results in the following section.
