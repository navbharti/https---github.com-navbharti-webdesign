COPY OF PRACTICE CONTROL FLOW_EXERCISE
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1)Write a python script which will -
Take an integer from the user as input
If the number is positive, print "Positive"
If the number is negative, say -10 print "Negative of 10"
If the number is zero, print "Zero"
Finally, print "Done"

Solution:
x=int(input())
if x<0:
	print("Negative of",abs(x))
elif x>0:
	print("Positive")
else:
	print("Zero")
print("Done")


2)Write a python script which will -
Take two integers from the user as input one on each line
Let these numbers be x and y
Print -
"first" if x > y
"second" if x < y
"same" if x = y

Solution:
x=int(input())
y=int(input())
if x:y:
	print("first")
	highest=x
elif y>x:
	print("second")
	highest=y
else:
	print("same")
	highest=x
print(highest*highest)


3)Write a python script to print the numbers from 1 to 10 using While loop.

Solution:
x=1
while x<11:
	print(x)
	x+=1

4)Write a python script to print the odd numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.

Solution:
x=1
while x<11:
	print(x)
	x+=2

5)Write a python script to generate the numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
If a number, divisible by 3 is found, print ***
If a number, divisible by 5 is found, print *****
If a number is not divisible by either 3 or 5 , print the number

Hence, the output should be:
1
2
***
4
*****
***
7
8
***
*****

Solution:
x=1
while x<11:
	if x%3==0:
		print('***')
	elif x%5==0:
		print('*****')
	else:
		print(x)
	x+=1

6)Write a python script to generate the numbers from 10 to 1 using a while loop. For each number in the iteration, print that many *.
So the output should be,
The expected output is - 
**********
*********
********
*******
******
*****
****
***
**
*

Solution:
x=10
while x>0:
	print('*'*x)
	x=-1

7)Write a python script which will take an integer n from the user as input, where n >= 2
Use a while loop to print n numbers uniformly spaced between 0 and 1. Include 0 and 1 while printing.

Solution:
n=int(input())
dx=1.0/(n-1)
x=0.0
while x<(1.0-dx/2):
	print(x)
	x+=dx
print(1.0)

8)Write a python script which will -
Take an integer from the user as input
Print the multiplication table of that integer till 10

Solution:
n=int(input())
for i in range(1,11):
	print(n,'x',i,'=',n*i)

9)Write a python script that accepts an integer n as input (where n >= 1)
The script should print the first n numbers of the fibonacci sequence

Solution:
n=int(input())
a,b=0,1
print(a)
for i in range(n-1):
	print(b)
	a,b=b,a+b

10)Write a python script that will;
Accept an integer n
Create a list containing integers from 1 to n Output must print each value of the list in a separate line For

Solution:
n=int(input())
for x in range(1,n+1):
	print(x)

11)Write a Python script that accepts an integer n as input. Use numpyâ€™s linspace to create n points from 1 to 2
The script must print each value from the array in a separate line.

For Example;
Input
3
Output:
1.0
1.5
2.0


Solution:
from numpy import linspace
n=int(input())
data=linspace(1,2,n)
for x in data:
	print(x)

12)Write a python script that accepts a list of fruits separated by a comma
The script must print each fruit in a separate line

For example:
Input:
apple,pear,banana

Output:
apple
pear
banana


Solution:
fruits=input()
fruits=fruits.split(',')
for fruit in fruits:
	print(fruit)

13)Write a python script that accepts a string as input
The script must print each character of the string using a for loop. For example;
Input:
box
Output
b
o
x


Solution:
s=input()
for char in s:
	print(char)

14)Write a python script that accepts an integer nas user input (with empty prompt)
The script must print an n x n matrix where each entry is the sum of the row number and column number For example;
Input:
3
Output:
0 1 2
1 2 3
2 3 4

Solution:
n=int(input())
for i in range(n):
	for j in range(n):
		print(i+j,end=' ')
	print()

15)Find the first number in the Fibonacci sequence that is divisible by 4 but more than 8 and less than 500.

Solution:
a,b=0,1
while b<500:
	if b%4==0 and b>8:
		print(b)
		break
	a,b=b,a+b
